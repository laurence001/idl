## Information Disorder Level Index (IDLI)

The assessment of automatically generated content is most reliable when done humanely. It involves critical thinking about the meaning of the information and its informative or disinformative value, which is related to the accuracy and reliability of the news. The Information Disorders Level Index (IDLI) is a human-based judgement metric. It is language-independent and was developed to evaluate content generated by large language model systems in the context of academic research.
